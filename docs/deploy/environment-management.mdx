Manage multiple environments using [Terraform workspaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces) and variable files.

## Using Workspaces

```bash
# Create workspaces
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod

# Deploy to dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars

# Deploy to prod
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply -var-file=environments/prod.tfvars
```

## Environment-Specific Configuration

```hcl title="environments/dev.tfvars"
services_api_memory = 512
services_api_timeout = 10
```

```hcl title="environments/prod.tfvars"
services_api_memory = 2048
services_api_timeout = 30
```
