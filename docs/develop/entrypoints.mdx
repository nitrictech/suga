Entrypoints provide HTTP access to your application through CDN and routing configuration. They act as the front door to your services and static assets.

## What is an Entrypoint?

An entrypoint is a CDN + router that:
- **Routes HTTP requests** - To services or buckets based on URL paths
- **Provides HTTPS** - Automatic SSL/TLS termination
- **Caches responses** - CDN caching for performance
- **Handles scaling** - Automatically scales with traffic

```yaml title="Basic entrypoint"
entrypoints:
  web:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    routes:
      /api/: 
        name: api          # Route /api/* to api service
      /: 
        name: frontend         # Route /* to frontend service
```

## Route Configuration

Routes map URL paths to destinations:

```yaml
entrypoints:
  subtype: # your choice, from target platform
  web:
    routes:
      /api/: 
        name: api-service      # Service destination
      /static/: 
        name: assets        # Bucket destination
      /: 
        name: frontend             # Service destination
```

**Path Matching:**
- `/api/` - Matches `/api/*` (with trailing content)
- `/` - Matches all remaining paths

Routes are evaluated in order - most specific first.

## Custom Domains

<Note>
  Most entrypoints support custom domains, however, this functionality is [platform](/core/platforms.mdx) specific.

  For example, the `suga/aws` platform will generate Terraform Variables during `suga build`, which allow you to specify a custom domain per entrypoint.

## Common Patterns

**API + Frontend:**
```yaml
entrypoints:
  web:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    routes:
      /api/: 
        name: api
      /: 
        name: frontend
```

**Microservices Gateway:**
```yaml
entrypoints:
  gateway:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    routes:
      /users/: 
        name: users-service
      /products/: 
        name: products-service
      /orders/: 
        name: orders-service
```

**Static Site with API:**
```yaml
entrypoints:
  web:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    routes:
      /api/: 
        name: api
      /: 
        name: static-assets  # Bucket with static files
```
