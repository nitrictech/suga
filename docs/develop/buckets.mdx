Buckets provide cloud object storage for your application - think files, images, videos, documents, and other unstructured data.

## What is a Bucket?

A bucket is object storage that:
- **Stores files** - Any file type, any size
- **Configurable access** - Set read, write, delete permissions
- **Scales automatically** - No capacity planning needed
- **Works everywhere** - Same interface locally and in production

```yaml title="Basic bucket definition"
buckets:
  uploads:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    access:
      api: [read, write, delete]
  profile-images:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    access:
      api: [read, write]
      frontend: [read]
```

## Bucket Configuration

### Access Control

Grant services access to buckets:

```yaml
buckets:
  uploads:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    access:
      api: [read, write, delete]   # Full access
      worker: [read, delete]       # Read and delete only
      frontend: [read]             # Read-only
```

**Permission Types:**
- `read` - Download/read files
- `write` - Upload/write files  
- `delete` - Delete files
- `all` - Shorthand for read, write, delete

### Content Path (Static Files)

Deploy static files to a bucket:

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    content_path: ./build  # Deploy React/Vue/Angular build

entrypoints:
  web:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    routes:
      /: frontend  # Serve static files from bucket
```

When you deploy, files from `./build` are uploaded to the bucket.

## Using Buckets in Code

With Suga's generated SDK:

  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { SugaClient } from './suga/client';

    const suga = new SugaClient();

    // Write file
    await suga.uploads.write('path/to/file.txt', Buffer.from('data'));

    // Read file
    const data = await suga.uploads.read('path/to/file.txt');

    // Delete file
    await suga.uploads.delete('path/to/file.txt');
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from suga.client import SugaClient

    suga = SugaClient()

    # Write file
    suga.uploads.write('path/to/file.txt', b'data')

    # Read file
    data = suga.uploads.read('path/to/file.txt')

    # Delete file
    suga.uploads.delete('path/to/file.txt')
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Go">
    ```go
    import "myapp/suga"

    client, _ := suga.NewClient()

    // Write file
    client.Uploads.Write("path/to/file.txt", []byte("data"))

    // Read file
    data, _ := client.Uploads.Read("path/to/file.txt")

    // Delete file
    client.Uploads.Delete("path/to/file.txt")
    ```
  </Tab>

## Local Development

During `suga dev`, buckets are emulated using the filesystem:

```
.suga/
└── buckets/
    └── uploads/
        └── file.txt
```

You can:
- View files in `.suga/buckets/{bucket-name}/`
- Seed buckets by placing files there
- Test bucket operations without cloud access
