Suga applications are built from several core resource types that work together to create complete cloud applications. This page introduces these resources and explains how they interact.

## Suga Resources

Every Suga application can use these resource types:

  <Card title="Services" icon="server" href="/develop/services">
    Application containers that run your code
  </Card>

  <Card title="Entrypoints" icon="network" href="/develop/entrypoints">
    HTTP routing and CDN configuration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Buckets" icon="box" href="/develop/buckets">
    Object storage for files and assets
  </Card>

  <Card title="Databases" icon="database" href="/develop/databases">
    PostgreSQL databases for structured data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Resource Relationships

Resources connect to form your application architecture:

## Defining Resources

Resources are defined in `suga.yaml`:

```yaml title="suga.yaml"
target: suga/aws@1
name: my-app
description: My cloud application

services:
  # Define services here

buckets:
  # Define buckets here

databases:
  # Define databases here

entrypoints:
  # Define entrypoints here
```

### Using the Visual Editor

The easiest way to define resources is with the visual editor, by running the `edit` command in your project directory:

```bash
suga edit
```

The visual editor provides:
- **Drag-and-drop** resource creation, using the available resource from your chosen platform
- **Visual connections** to establish relationships and access
- **Property editors** for configurations of resources
- **Real-time validation** of your architecture and configuration
- **Automatic YAML sync** with bidirectional live update to your project's suga.yaml file
- **AI Assistant** that can collaborate with you on your design

### Editing YAML Directly

You can also edit `suga.yaml` directly:

```yaml title="suga.yaml"
services:
  api:
    subtype: # your choice, from target platform
    container:
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        context: .
    dev:
      script: npm run dev
```

## Resource Naming

Resource names must follow these rules:

- **Lowercase letters and numbers** - `api`, `api2`, `frontend`
- **Underscores allowed** - `api_service`, `user_uploads`
- **Start with letter** - `api` (not `2api`)
- **No special characters** - Avoid `-`, `.`, `/`, etc.

<Warning>
  Resource names typically become part of cloud resource identifiers. Choose names that are descriptive and unlikely to change.
</Warning>

## Resource Configuration

Each resource type has unique configuration options; however, there are some common configuration options.

### Subtypes

Cloud provider like AWS provide many container and compute runtime options including EC2, ECS and Fargate, Lambda, EKS, and more. The list gets longer as you look to other cloud providers.

The same is true for other resources like Buckets, which might use S3 on AWS, Cloud Storage on GCP, Blob Storage on Azure or another option like self-hosted Minio on Kubernetes.

Suga helps you build applications that work well on any of these services without significant modifications to your application code. Reducing vendor lock-in and the cost of change. This allows you to migrate between services during development or as you better understand the performance, cost and other needs of your applications.

The resource subtype in the `suga.yaml` file is how you tell Suga which specific service you want to use:

```yaml title="Choose specific cloud service"
services:
  api:
    subtype: lambda       # AWS Lambda (serverless)
  worker:
    subtype: fargate      # AWS Fargate (containers)

buckets:
  uploads:
    subtype: s3           # AWS S3

entrypoints:
  web:
    subtype: cloudfront   # AWS CloudFront
```

The available subtypes depend on your target [platform](/core/platforms):
- `suga/aws@1` - Lambda, Fargate, S3, CloudFront
- `suga/gcp@1` - Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Cloud CDN
- `you/custom@1` - Any other cloud or resources you like, including cross-cloud deployments

### Access Control

Resources can grant access to services:

```yaml title="Grant service access to resources"
buckets:
  uploads:
    ...
    access:
      api: [read, write, delete]   # API service can read/write/delete
      frontend: [read]             # Frontend can only read

databases:
  main:
    ...
    access:
      api: [query]                 # API service can query the database
```

This generates appropriate IAM policies or service account permissions.

## Accessing Resources from Code

Once you've defined resources in your `suga.yaml`, Suga provides generated client libraries for cloud-agnostic resource access. The same code works locally with `suga dev` and in production across any cloud provider.
