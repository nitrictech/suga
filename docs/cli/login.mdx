Login to the Suga CLI.

```bash
suga login
```

Opens your browser to complete the authentication flow with the Suga platform. This is required for most CLI operations.

## What happens during login

1. Opens your default web browser
2. Redirects you to the Suga authentication page
3. After successful authentication, returns you to the CLI
4. Securely stores your auth token in your system's keychain

## Example

```bash
suga login
```

<Note>
  You'll need to login before using most Suga CLI commands. Your session will remain active until you explicitly logout or the session expires.
