description: "Understanding Suga projects - the application specifications that define your cloud architecture"
---

Projects in Suga are application specifications that define your cloud architecture using abstract resource types. They're declarative YAML configurations that describe what your application needs - services, storage, databases, and networking - without being tied to specific cloud implementations.

## What is a Project?

A Suga project is defined by a `suga.yaml` file that describes your application's infrastructure requirements using cloud-agnostic resource types. When combined with a [Platform](/platforms), this specification gets transformed into deployable cloud infrastructure.

## Project Structure

### Basic Configuration

Every project starts with basic metadata and target platforms:

```yaml title="Basic project configuration"
name: project-name
description: Brief description of your application

targets:
  - suga/aws@1 # Deploy to AWS
  - suga/gcp@1 # Also deploy to GCP
```

- **name**: Project identifier (used in Terraform stack and resource naming)
- **description**: Human-readable project description
- **targets**: List of platforms this project can use for deployments

### Resource Types

Projects currently offer four main resource types:

- **[Services](#services)** - Application containers that handle business logic
- **[Buckets](#buckets)** - Cloud storage for files, images, and other assets
- **[Entrypoints](#entrypoints)** - HTTP routing and CDN configuration to expose your application
- **[Databases](#databases)** - Persistent data storage with access controls (currently PostgreSQL only)

#### Services

Services are your application containers that handle business logic:

```yaml title="Service definitions"
services:
  app:
    env:
      EXT_URL: https://somewhere.example.com
    container:
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        context: .
    dev:
      script: npm run dev

  worker:
    container:
      image:
        id: "my-registry/worker:latest"
```

Services support:

- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Container definitions** (Dockerfile or pre-built images)
- **Development scripts** for local testing with the `suga dev` CLI command

#### Buckets

Buckets provide cloud storage for files, images, and other assets:

```yaml title="Bucket definitions"
buckets:
  uploads:
    access:
      app:
        - read
        - write
        - delete

  public-assets:
    content_path: ./build-static
    access:
      app:
        - read
```

Bucket access permissions define which services can read, write or delete files in the bucket.

Buckets can optionally include a `content_path` which, if provided, is used to seed the bucket with files during deployments. This is useful when you want to deploy static website assets, then route to them via an entrypoint.

#### Entrypoints

Entrypoints expose your application to the internet, typically through CDNs and/or load balancers:

```yaml title="Entrypoint definitions"
entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /:
        name: public-assets
      /api/:
        name: app
```

Routes map URL patterns to services or storage buckets.

#### Databases

Databases provide persistent SQL data storage (currently PostgreSQL only):

```yaml title="Database definitions"
databases:
  main:
    access:
      api:
        - query
```

Database access controls which services can access and query the database.

## Project Benefits

### Deployment-Agnostic Architecture

Projects describe _what_ your application needs, not _how_ it's implemented:

- **Portable designs** that work across different cloud providers
- **Platform independence** - switch from one AWS service to another, or to another cloud like GCP without changing your project
- **Future-proof architecture** that adapts as platforms evolve

### Developer Experience

Projects enable smooth local development and deployment workflows:

- **Local emulation** - Test with emulated cloud services on your machine using `suga dev`
- **Hot reloading** - Services restart automatically when code changes
- **Environment parity** - Same resource relationships locally and in production

### Platform Team Control

Projects maintain separation between application architecture and infrastructure implementation:

- **Governance enforcement** - Platform teams control how resources get deployed
- **Security policies** - Access patterns and configurations managed at the platform level
- **Operational consistency** - Standardized deployment and monitoring across teams

## Project Lifecycle

### 1. Design Phase

Define your application architecture using the visual editor or by editing `suga.yaml` directly:

- Drag and drop resources onto the canvas
- Connect services to storage and databases
- Configure access permissions and routing
- Set environment variables and deployment options

### 2. Development Phase

Test your project locally with emulated cloud services:

```bash
suga dev
```

- Services run using your `dev.script` commands
- Storage operations use local filesystem
- Database connections point to local instances
- HTTP requests route through local entrypoints

### 3. Build Phase

Generate cloud-specific infrastructure from your project:

```bash
suga build
```

- Suga combines your project with the target platform specifications
- Terraform stacks are generated for your target platform using pre-built modules
- Resource dependencies and networking get configured automatically

### 4. Deploy Phase

Deploy the generated infrastructure using Terraform:

```bash
cd .suga/stacks/my-app-aws-*
terraform init
terraform apply
```
