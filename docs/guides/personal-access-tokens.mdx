Treat your access tokens like passwords. For more information, see [Token Security Best Practices](#token-security-best-practices).

## Overview

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to Suga when using the Suga CLI or API.

Personal access tokens are intended to access Suga resources on your behalf. A token has similar capabilities to access resources and perform actions that you have as the token owner, with a few restrictions.

You can use a personal access token to:

- Authenticate the Suga CLI in CI/CD environments
- Make direct API calls to Suga services
- Automate workflows without interactive device authorization flow

You can't use a personal access token to:

- Manage tokens (create, revoke, or edit personal access tokens)
- Access the Suga Agent chat API (use the [Suga CLI MCP server](/guides/mcp-integration) for AI-assisted development instead)

## Creating a Personal Access Token

<Note>
Personal access tokens will become inactive if you lose access to the resources they were created for, such as when you're removed from a team or project.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Log in to [Suga](https://app.addsuga.com) and click the **Settings** link in the navigation menu, then click on **Personal Access Tokens** in the sidebar.

      alt="Personal Access Tokens settings page showing the list of tokens with options to generate new tokens"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a New Token">
    Click the **Generate Token** button to open the token creation modal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Token">
    In the token creation modal, provide the following information:

    **Token Name** (required)
    - A descriptive name to help you identify the token's purpose
    - Example: "GitHub Actions CI", "Production Deploy", "Local Development"

    **Expiration** (required)

    Select an expiration for the token. You should choose the shortest expiration that meets your needs.

    - **7 Days** - Short-term tokens for temporary access or testing
    - **30 Days** - Standard tokens for most use cases
    - **60 Days** - Medium-term tokens for ongoing projects
    - **90 Days** - Long-term tokens for stable workflows
    - **Custom Date** - Specify an exact expiration date
    - **No Expiration** - Token never expires (**not recommended**)

<Warning>
    We recommend against using "No Expiration". For long-term automation, use tokens with defined expiration dates (such as 90 days) and implement a rotation process.
    </Warning>

    **Description** (optional)
    - Additional context about the token's purpose or usage
    - Helps with token management and auditing

      alt="Generate Personal Access Token modal showing fields for token name, expiration date options, and optional description"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Your Token">
    After submitting the form, your token will be displayed **one time only**.

    <Warning>
    **Important**: Copy the token immediately and store it securely. You will not be able to view this token value again. If you lose the token, you'll need to generate a new one.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Security Best Practices

Personal access tokens are like passwords, and they share the same inherent security risks. Before creating a new personal access token, consider if there is a more secure method of authentication available to you:

- To access Suga from the command line, you can use `suga login` with the device authorization flow instead of creating a personal access token
- When using a personal access token in a GitHub Actions workflow, consider storing your token as a secret. For more information, see [CI/CD Authentication](/guides/cicd-authentication)

### Keeping your personal access tokens secure

When using a personal access token in a script, you can store your token as a secret and run your script through GitHub Actions or another CI/CD platform. You can also store your token in environment variables.

For best practices:

- **Treat tokens like passwords** - Never share tokens or commit them to version control
- **Store tokens securely** - Use environment variables or secret management services (like GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- **Use descriptive names** - Make tokens easy to identify and manage
- **Set appropriate expiration** - Choose the shortest expiration that meets your needs
- **Rotate regularly** - Periodically regenerate tokens used in production, even before expiration
- **Revoke unused tokens** - Immediately delete tokens that are no longer needed
- **Create separate tokens** - Use different tokens for different purposes rather than reusing the same token everywhere
- **Monitor token usage** - Regularly review your active tokens and their last used timestamps in the Settings page
- **Revoke on breach** - If a token is compromised, revoke it immediately and investigate what resources may have been accessed

## Managing Tokens

### Viewing Active Tokens

In the Personal Access Tokens section, you can view:
- Token names and descriptions
- Creation timestamps
- Expiration timestamps
- Last used timestamps

### Revoking Tokens

To revoke a token:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens**
2. Find the token you want to revoke
3. Click the **Delete** button
4. Confirm the revocation

Revoked tokens are immediately invalidated and cannot be restored.
