description: "Deploy static websites and single-page applications with Suga"
---

Host static websites and single-page applications (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) with Suga using buckets and entrypoints for CDN-backed delivery.

## How It Works

Static website hosting in Suga combines two resources:

1. **Bucket** - Stores your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
2. **Entrypoint** - Routes traffic to the bucket through a CDN

```yaml title="Basic static site"
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./build  # Your build output directory

entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /: frontend  # Serve files from bucket
```

When you deploy:
1. Files from `./build` are uploaded to the bucket
2. The entrypoint (CDN) serves files from the bucket
3. Users access your site via HTTPS with automatic SSL

## Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Deploy React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte applications:

```yaml title="suga.yaml"
target: suga/aws@1
name: my-app

buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./dist  # Vite/Vue/Angular build output

entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /: frontend
```

**Build your app, then deploy:**

```bash
# Build your frontend
npm run build

# Generate infrastructure
suga build

# Deploy
cd terraform/stacks/my-app
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Your SPA is now live with CDN delivery and HTTPS!

## Static Site + API

Most applications need both frontend and backend. Route different paths to different destinations:

```yaml title="Frontend + Backend"
services:
  api:
    dev:
      script: npm run dev
    container:
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        context: .

buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./frontend/build

entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /api/: api      # API requests go to service
      /: frontend     # Everything else goes to static files
```

**How routing works:**
- `https://yoursite.com/` → Static files from bucket
- `https://yoursite.com/about` → Static files from bucket
- `https://yoursite.com/api/users` → API service
- `https://yoursite.com/api/products` → API service

## Multi-Page Applications

Deploy traditional multi-page websites:

```yaml
buckets:
  website:
    content_path: ./public

entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /: website
```

**Directory structure:**

```
public/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
└── images/
    └── logo.png
```

All files are uploaded to the bucket and served via CDN.

## Build Process Integration

Integrate with your existing build tools:

### React (Create React App / Vite)

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./build  # CRA output
    # OR
    content_path: ./dist   # Vite output
```

```bash
npm run build
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

### Vue.js

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./dist
```

```bash
npm run build
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

### Angular

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./dist/my-app  # Angular outputs to dist/project-name
```

```bash
ng build --configuration production
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

### Next.js (Static Export)

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./out
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build && next export"
  }
}
```

```bash
npm run build
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

### Svelte/SvelteKit

```yaml
buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./build
```

```bash
npm run build
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

## Custom Domains

Most platforms support custom domains through Terraform variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
    After running `suga build`, configure your domain:

    ```hcl title="terraform/stacks/my-app/terraform.tfvars"
    entrypoint_web_domain = "www.example.com"
    entrypoint_web_certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:..."
    ```

    Then apply:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    <Note>
      AWS requires ACM certificates in `us-east-1` for CloudFront. Create your certificate in ACM first.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GCP">
    After running `suga build`, configure your domain:

    ```hcl title="terraform/stacks/my-app/terraform.tfvars"
    entrypoint_web_domain = "www.example.com"
    ```

    Then apply:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Environment Variables in Frontend

Frontend applications often need runtime configuration (API URLs, feature flags, etc.):

### Build-time Variables

```yaml title="suga.yaml"
services:
  api:
    dev:
      script: npm run dev

buckets:
  frontend:
    content_path: ./build

entrypoints:
  web:
    routes:
      /api/: api
      /: frontend
```

```javascript title=".env.production"
REACT_APP_API_URL=/api
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

Build and deploy:

```bash
npm run build  # Variables baked into bundle
suga build
cd terraform/stacks/my-app && terraform apply
```

## Local Development

During `suga dev`:

```bash
suga dev
```

- Buckets are emulated in `.suga/buckets/`
- Static files are served from the local filesystem
- Changes to files in `content_path` require rebuild and re-upload in production

**Development workflow:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run Suga dev server
suga dev

# Terminal 2: Run frontend dev server separately
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Usually runs on :3000 or :5173
```

During development, use your framework's dev server (with hot reload) rather than the production build.
