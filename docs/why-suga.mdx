---

Suga bridges the gap between developer productivity and enterprise control. It combines visual infrastructure design with platform-driven governance to deliver fast, production-ready deployments while maintaining complete flexibility and control.

## What Makes Suga Different?

Suga takes a unique approach to cloud infrastructure by combining three key capabilities:

**Visual Design with Code Generation**
- Design your architecture visually in an intuitive editor
- Generate production-ready Terraform automatically
- Maintain full control over the generated infrastructure

**Platform-Driven Governance**
- Platform teams define reusable blueprints and standards
- Developers get guardrails, not blockers
- Organizations enforce policies while enabling velocity

### Visual Design + Generated Infrastructure

Design your architecture visually, then generate production-ready Terraform. No more choosing between developer experience and infrastructure control.

```yaml title="Design becomes configuration"
entrypoints:
  api:
    routes:
      /:
        name: frontend
      /api/:
        name: app

services:
  app:
    dev:
      script: npm run dev
  frontend:
    dev:
      script: npm run dev

buckets:
  bucket:
    access:
      app: [read, write]
```

```bash title="Configuration becomes Terraform"
suga build
# ✓ Terraform generated successfully
#   output written to terraform/stacks/my-app
```

### Platform-Driven Governance

Platform teams create reusable blueprints that enforce organizational standards while delivering seamless developer experiences.

**For Developers:**
- Visual infrastructure design
- Local development with emulated cloud services
- Deploy anywhere without changing code
- Generated type-safe client libraries (Node.js, Python, Go, etc)

**For Platform Teams:**
- Enforce security policies and compliance
- Control cloud resource configurations
- Standardize architectures across teams
- Audit and govern all deployments

### True Multi-Cloud

Not just provider-agnostic abstractions - Suga generates native Terraform for each cloud provider while keeping your application code portable.

```yaml title="Same application, different clouds"
# Deploy to AWS
target: suga/aws@1

# Or deploy to GCP
target: suga/gcp@1
```

The generated Terraform uses native cloud resources (Lambda, Cloud Run, S3, Cloud Storage) with proper networking, IAM, and security configurations.

## How is Suga Different?

### vs. Developer Platforms

Suga provides a similar developer experience to hosted platforms while giving you complete control over the generated infrastructure.

| Aspect | Hosted Platforms | Suga |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| **Deployment Speed** | Instant | Instant (after first Terraform apply) |
| **Infrastructure Control** | Platform-managed | Complete (generated Terraform) |
| **Cloud Provider** | Platform-specific | Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, custom) |
| **Customization** | Platform-limited | Full platform customization |
| **Local Development** | Platform-dependent | Full local emulation |
| **Cost Model** | Platform pricing | Direct cloud provider rates |
| **Governance** | Platform-dictated | Organization-controlled |

**Use Suga if:** You want great developer experience but need full control, multi-cloud support, or enterprise governance.

### vs. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi)

Suga builds on top of IaC tools rather than replacing them. It generates standard Terraform that you can inspect, modify, and manage with your existing workflows.

| Aspect | Direct Terraform/Pulumi | Suga |
|--------|------------------------|------|
| **Approach** | Write infrastructure code | Generate from high-level design |
| **Visual Design** | External tools | Built-in visual editor |
| **Local Development** | Manual setup | `suga dev` |
| **Reusability** | Modules (per-project) | Platforms (organization-wide) |
| **Standardization** | Code reviews & guidelines | Platform-enforced patterns |
| **Flexibility** | Complete control | Extensible platforms + direct Terraform access |

**Use Suga if:** You want to maximize reuse across teams, enforce organizational standards, or accelerate delivery with visual design while keeping Terraform's flexibility.

**Use Suga with Terraform if:** You need both platform standardization and custom infrastructure - Suga generates Terraform you can augment with custom resources.

### vs. Nitric (Suga's Inspiration)

Suga is built by the team behind [Nitric](https://nitric.io) and incorporates lessons from years of cloud framework development.

| Aspect | Nitric | Suga |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Approach** | Code-first | Configuration-first |
| **Infrastructure Definition** | Application code annotations | Separate `suga.yaml` + visual editor |
| **Deployment** | Pulumi or Terraform | Terraform |
| **Visual Design** | None | Core feature |
| **Platform System** | Provider plugins | Distributed platform packages |
| **Target Audience** | Developer-focused | Multi-role teams (platform engineers, SREs, DevOps, developers) |

**Use Suga if:** You work in organizations with multiple roles (platform teams, SREs, DevOps, developers) who need specialized tooling for their responsibilities.

**Use Nitric if:** You're a developer team that prefers defining infrastructure directly in application code.

## When to Use Suga

### ✅ Ideal Use Cases

**Enterprise Development Teams**
