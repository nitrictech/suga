Each plugin provides a specific infrastructure capability - like storage, compute, or networking. Compose these plugins to build complete platforms across multiple cloud providers.

## Compose Plugins to Build your Platform

1. **Open the Suga editor** to build your platform:

   ```bash
   suga edit
   ```

2. **Add plugins** into your platform and configure parameters using this reference

<Tip>
Reference outputs from other plugins using `${type.name.output}` syntax, e.g. `${infra.vpc.vpc_id}` or `${databases.main.connection_string}`
</Tip>

3. **Deploy your platform**:
   - Click "Commit revision" in the editor to update your platform
   - Update the target in your `suga.yaml` to build terraform using your platform with the plugins that you have composed:

   ```yaml
   targets:
     - suga/aws@2
   ```
