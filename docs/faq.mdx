## General

### What is Suga?

Suga is a cloud development platform that combines visual infrastructure design with platform-driven governance. It generates production-ready Terraform from high-level application specifications, enabling developers to deploy instantly while platform teams maintain complete control.

### How is Suga different from other tools?

See our [Why Suga?](/why-suga) page for detailed comparisons with PaaS platforms, raw Terraform/Pulumi, and serverless frameworks.

### Is Suga open source?

The Suga CLI, official platforms and plugins are open-source, including the Terraform generation code (engines).

You can access, review and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/suga)

### What cloud providers does Suga support?

- **AWS** - Lambda, Fargate, S3, CloudFront (full support)
- **GCP** - Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Cloud CDN (full support)
- **Azure** - Coming soon

Custom platforms can target any cloud provider, using standard Terraform Modules.

## Getting Started

### Do I need cloud provider experience?

Basic familiarity helps, but Suga abstracts much of the complexity. You can deploy without being a cloud expert.

### Can I use Suga with my existing application?

Yes! See the [Add Suga to Existing Apps](/guides/add-suga) guide.

### Do I need to learn Terraform?

No, but understanding Terraform basics can help when customizing deployments. Suga generates all Terraform for you.

### Can I develop without cloud access?

Yes! `suga dev` provides local emulation of cloud services with no cloud account or internet connection needed.

## Technical

### What languages does Suga support?

Services can be written in any language that runs in a container (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, etc.).

The optional SDK client generation currently supports:
- Node.js/TypeScript
- Python
- Go

### Can I use custom cloud configurations?

Yes, you can:
1. Override platform variables
2. Add custom Terraform resources
3. Create custom platforms
4. Build custom plugins

### How does Suga handle state?

Suga uses standard Terraform state management. Use remote backends (S3, GCS, Terraform Cloud) for team collaboration.

### Can I migrate away from Suga?

Yes. The generated Terraform is standard and can be maintained independently if you decide to stop using Suga.

### Does Suga support Kubernetes?

Not yet, but Kubernetes platform support is planned.

## Deployment

### How much does deployment cost?

Suga is free to get started, you can see complete pricing details on the [pricing page](https://addsuga.com/pricing)

There is no Suga markup on cloud costs.

### How long does deployment take?

First deployment: 5-15 minutes (Terraform provisioning cloud resources)
Code updates: 1-5 minutes (depends on service type and cloud provider)

### Can I deploy to multiple environments?

Yes! Use Terraform workspaces or separate state files:

```bash
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new dev
```

### How do I roll back a deployment?

Revert your code changes, rebuild with `suga build`, and `terraform apply`. Terraform will update to the previous configuration.

### What happens if deployment fails?

Terraform will show the error and leave your infrastructure in a consistent state. Fix the issue and run `terraform apply` again.

## Development

### Can I use my own frameworks?

Yes! Suga works with Express, FastAPI, Django, Go HTTP, and any other framework that runs in a container.

### How do I debug services locally?

Use your language's standard debugger with `suga dev`. See the [Local Development](/core/local-development) guide.

### Can services communicate with each other?

Currently, services communicate through shared databases or buckets. Direct service-to-service communication is coming soon.

### What if I need a resource type that doesn't exist?

You can:
1. Add custom Terraform resources to your stack
2. Create a custom plugin for the resource
3. Request the feature for official platforms
4. Extend Suga through [open source contributions](https://github.com/nitrictech/suga)

## Platform & Plugin Development

### Who should create platforms?

Platform teams, DevOps/SRE teams, or anyone wanting to standardize infrastructure across an organization.

### Can I customize official platforms?

You can't modify official platforms directly, but you can:
1. Fork and customize them as your own private or public platforms
2. Override configurations through Terraform variables
3. Add custom resources alongside generated ones

### How do I share platforms with my team?

Publish platforms to your organization's Suga account. Team members can then target your custom platforms.

### Do plugins require special permissions?

Plugins are Terraform modules and run with your cloud provider credentials during `terraform apply`. They have the same permissions as any Terraform code.

## Pricing & Licensing

### Is Suga free?

Suga is free to sign-up and has paid offering for teams and enterprise, see the [pricing page](https://addsuga.com/pricing) for complete details.

You only pay your cloud provider for infrastructure resources.

### Do I need a Suga account?

Yes, a Suga account is required. Sign up at [addsuga.com](https://app.addsuga.com/signup).

In the future, some features may work without an account.

### Can I use Suga for commercial projects?

Yes, Suga is designed for production use in commercial applications.

## Security

### How secure is Suga?

- Suga generates standard Terraform with least-privilege IAM policies
- Your code and infrastructure remain in your cloud account
- Suga CLI only communicates with Suga platform services for authentication and platform/plugin retrieval
- No application code is sent to Suga servers

### Where is my data stored?

- Application data: In your cloud provider account
- Terraform state: Where you configure it (local, S3, GCS, Terraform Cloud)
- Suga platform: Stores only account info and platform/plugin definitions

### Does Suga have access to my cloud resources?

No. Suga generates Terraform that you deploy with your own cloud credentials. Suga has no access to your deployed resources.

### How do I handle secrets?

Currently, use your cloud provider's secrets manager and reference via environment variables.
